<p><strong>DECO2800 Course - Rocket Potatoes - Jul 2017 - Nov 2017</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Project description <a href="https://github.com/UQdeco2800/deco2800-2017-rocketpotatoes">Github Link</a>: This team game project is a tower defense class developed using Java and libGDX. game.</li>
<li>Personal contribution: I am responsible for the animation of all characters in the team, writing apis, synthesizing animations using images of different actions for each character
<strong>CSSE2310 Individual Assignment - Jul 2018 - Oct 2019</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brakchen/CSSE2310-2018s2">Github Link</a>:This is a very challenging and difficult task which needs to be completed in c language individually. It is composed of: Linux network programming (Socket), multi-process/multi-threaded programming (Under Linux), c program debugging (GDB) Under Linux, communication between Pipe processes, and Linux file system.
<strong>ENGG1200</strong></li>
<li>Project description: this is a project about the construction of an unpowered aircraft. The aircraft takes off by launcher , and an aduino accelerometer is installed on the back of the aircraft. The accelerometer uses the z-axis of the altitude value to determine whether it is taking off or landing.</li>
<li>Personal contribution: I was mainly responsible for analyzing the simulated value of the accelerometer to judge the takeoff and landing status of the aircraft, and finally calculating the flight time of the aircraft. In this project, this code was the only one among all the teams that got full marks, because the take-off and landing time calculation was very accurate.</li>
